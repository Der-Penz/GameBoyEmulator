# GameBoy Emulator

## Overview
This is a GameBoy emulator written in Java. It is my first attempt at writing an emulator. It was meant to be a development exercise to see what I was capable of. It took me over 6 Months to create this emulator.
I learned about emulation and Java by building this.

## Compatibility
passed the Blargg's CPU instruction test (See more at [COMPABILITY.MD](https://github.com/Der-Penz/GameBoyEmulator/blob/master/COMPABILITY.md). Most of the major games should work. Supported Memory Bank Controllers are MBC1, MBC2 and MBC3.
However, some games may not work perfectly due to emulation limitations. There is not yet any Gameboy Color support.
